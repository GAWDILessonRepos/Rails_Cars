# Rails_Cars

Process for making a rails app:

1) Tell rails to create the files and folders for you.
2) Start a rails server from your terminal so you can see what's going on.
3) Use rake to create database files.
4) Modify routes so that urls go to the correct action.
5) Create a controller. It should be a class with an index method.
6) Create an index view.
7) Create a migration, giving the framework for each object.
8) Create a model.
9) Use seed to create your objects.
10) Modify the controller to access the objects you've created.
11) Update index to display the objects in the browser/terminal/app/client/whatever.
